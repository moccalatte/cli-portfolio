  <p>Hi, I’m Dre — a multidisciplinary researcher, systems thinker, and builder.</p>
  <p>I treat every problem like an operating system: observe the running processes, trace the dependencies, and rewrite the parts that create drag. Most days I am mapping messy ecosystems, translating research into runnable strategies, and stress-testing new automations before they touch production.</p>
  <p>I believe healthy automation should feel invisible. That is why I build feedback-first workflows, pair qualitative field notes with quantitative telemetry, and obsess over graceful failure states. When nothing breaks, the system fades away and people can focus on higher-order questions.</p>
